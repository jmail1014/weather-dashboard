# Weather Dashboard

### Description
This is a weather application that asks the user to input a city name to search for the weather for that specific area. 
The user inputs a city name and then clicks search. The search is made through server side APIs and the application pulls the weather data back from here. 
The weather is displayed to the application in current weather and 5 day forecast output. The search history is collected and stored in local storage through the search history buttons displayed after a city is searched.
